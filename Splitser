Splitser

Goals:
    - Know which part of transaction is for me personally --> reports
    - Add all transactions, even though someone else paid for me
    - Know correct balance at all times

Idea:
    - Introduce splitser account which mimics balance on Splitser
    - Import transactions from Splitser to reduce work of copying all transactions in app

Situations:
    - I paid for someone else
        - Transaction visible in Rabobank app
        - Manually add transaction to Splitser app
        - Import transactions from Splitser
        - Add expense transaction for full amount to default account, no category and unconfirmed
        - Personal amount is full amount - splitsed amount.
        - Store splitsed transaction with expense transaction (to id it later)

    - Someone else paid for me 
        - Transactions visible in Splitser app
        - Import transactions from Splitser
        - Add expense transaction for splitser account, unconfirmed
        - Confirm transaction and specify category

        
    - Balance for splitser account is sum of all splitsed amounts of linked splitser transactions + sum of expense transactions
    - It is not possible to create/edit transactions for splitser account in Finance app. Everything is imported
    - Should have a page to confirm splitsed transactions --> Button to reload splitser transactions


Import splitsed transactions as transactions with splitsed amount.
    - Not editable
    - Edited splitsed transaction can update transaction
    - Add transaction to Splitser app. It will be imported within an hour, still have to add category



Paid for myself and someone else
	- 10 paid = 5 personal + 5 others
	- expense transactie 10 euro
	- personal amount 5 euro -> via linked Splitwise transactie
	- Splitwise account + 5 euro -> via linked Splitwise transactie

Paid for someone else
	- 10 paid = 10 others
	- expense transactie 10 euro
	- personal amount 0 euro
	- Splitwise account + 10 euro

Paid, together with someone else, for me and others
	- 10 paid + 40 paid others = 25 personal + 25 others
	- expense transactie 10 euro
	- personal amount = 25 -> 10 + 15 via Splitwise transactie
	- Splitwise account - 15

Someone else paid for me
	- expense transactie voor personal amount
